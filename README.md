Building a Convolutional Neural Networks using Lenet Architecture
Malaria Detection using LeNet Model
This repository contains code and resources for detecting malaria using the LeNet model. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Early and accurate detection of malaria is crucial for effective treatment and control of the disease.

Model Architecture
The LeNet model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was originally proposed for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The LeNet model has proven to be effective for image classification tasks and can be adapted for malaria detection.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of microscopic images of blood smear slides, with labels indicating whether the image contains malaria parasites (infected) or not (uninfected). The dataset used in this project can be obtained from various sources, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Malaria Dataset available on Kaggle.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
Keras (version 2.3 or higher)
NumPy
Matplotlib
